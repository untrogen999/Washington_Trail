This repository was created to revive the "Washington_Trail" project and website made in the Fall 2020 semester of
HUMAN-1050, taught at PITT Greensburg.

The original repo was hosted on the personal site of a
previous professor teaching HUMAN-1050; however, the website's owner removed the project's code,
taking down the project's website in the process. Thus, the primary goal for this revival project is to change any files and code
that were reliant on the old infrastructure so that the website lives again using Github Pages.

This project keeps changes to the original repo to the minimum, just enough to make the website
visible on the web again with functioning links.

Other than filling this README with, well, text, the most significant change done to the original project
was
inserting the navigation bar and footer in all files. Originally, the project relied on server-side
includes (HTML comments of a particular syntax that tell the hosting
server to insert HTML code from other files) to break up pieces of web pages, such as the navigation
bar, across files and include them into other files as needed. Since we can't do that with Github
Pages, the full HTML is included in the HTML instead.

Other than SSI includes, HTML file names were changed to be in all lowercase, to be more consistent since the menu bar was referencing file names with the wrong case for the first letter in some pages. Lastly, there were two versions of the menu bar on "map.html", and the more extensive version is now used on all pages.

The archiver could not find a license for the original project, but if there is one, this revival project attains the same license.

The original project repo, if you're
interested, is hosted also on Github, but it does not use Github Pages: [https://untrogen999.github.io/Washington_Trail](https://untrogen999.github.io/Washington_Trail).

This project will allow my team to track the times and movments of twenty-one-year-old George Washington as he travels from Virginia through current day western Pennsylvaia up to Fort LeBouf, which is in current day Waterford, Pennsylvania.
